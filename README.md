# todoAPICodacy
A simple Django Rest Framework todo CRUD API. To run this simple todo API, clone the git repository into your folder of choice and in your terminal preferably a virtual environment but depending on user's preference. 

In your terminal source your virtual environment using source (your_virtual_env)/bin/activate and for Windows OS  source venv/Scripts/activate from your git bash and run the requirments.txt file using pip or your prefered package manager, pip install requirements.txt and should be good to go not forgeting to set appropirate credentials for your database as it applies to you.
